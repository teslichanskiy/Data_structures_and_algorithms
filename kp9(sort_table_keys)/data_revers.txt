Now your life is out of season
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Just a rhyme without a reason
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Life of death becoming clearer
Needlework the way, never you betray
Leading on your death's construction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
I'm your source of self-destruction
End of passion play, crumbling away
