Needlework the way, never you betray
Now your life is out of season
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
End of passion play, crumbling away
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
I'm your source of self-destruction
Leading on your death's construction
Life of death becoming clearer
Just a rhyme without a reason
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
